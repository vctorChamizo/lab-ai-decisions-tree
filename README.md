# Lab | Artificial Intelligence - Decisions Tree

## Introduction

The ID3 algorithm is used in the scope of artificial intelligence. Its use is includes the search for hypotheses or rules, given a set of decisions.

It is a supervised learning system that applies the "divide and conquer" strategy to make the classification, implement methods and techniques for performing processes intelligent, this representing knowledge and learning, with the purpose of automate tasks ID3 performs this work by building a decision tree.

The goal would be to obtain a minimum decision tree based on a series of examples already classified.

## Documentation

The elements are:
- Nodes: will contain attributes.
- Branches: contain the possible values â€‹â€‹of the parent node.
- Sheets: classifies the selected option as positive or negative.

These decision trees are constructed inductively following an iterative process it begins at the root of the tree and ends at its leaves. To determine the classification of an object is asked successively at each node of the tree, starting with the root: which is the value of the attribute indicated by the node in the object? The branch of said value is then chosen until a sheet indicating one of theclass values.

## Technologies
The implementation of this project was carried out using **Java**.
